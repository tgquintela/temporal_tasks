2016-06-01

The risk-return tradeoff (also called the risk-return spectrum or risk-reward) is the relationship between the amount of return gained on an investment and the amount of risk undertaken in that investment. The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken.

This transforms a problem of investment in a multi-objective optimization problem in which we have to balance between the expected returns and the assumable risk.

There are various classes of possible investments, each with their own positions on the overall risk-return spectrum. The general progression is: short-term debt; long-term debt; property; high-yield debt; equity. There is considerable overlap of the ranges for each investment class.

One of the simple and most used measures for the risk-return tradeoff is the **Sharpe Ratio**.
