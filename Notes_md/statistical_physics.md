Statistical mechanics is a branch of theoretical physics that studies, using probability theory, the average behaviour of a mechanical system where the state of the system is uncertain. A common use of statistical mechanics is in explaining the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems.

We can split in two main branches:
* Equilibrium statistical mechanics
* Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics

The basic ideas of the statistical mechanics are:
* Complete mechanical state of the system could be encoded as a phase point or quantum state vector.
* Complete known evolution through equation of evolution as Hamilton's equations (classical mechanics) or time-dependent Schrödinger equation (quantum mechanics)

To understand the global behavior of the system we can do:
* Solving the complete interlace-equations system of large N (as it is done in the High-performance simulations)
* Using tools (statistical tools basically) to get some specific descriptors and predictors of the global phenomena of the system.
