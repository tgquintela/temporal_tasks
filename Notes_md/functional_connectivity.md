2016-06-01

Functional connectivity are the statistical dependencies of the activation of some parts or elements of the brain. The units correspond to individual neurons, neuronal populations, or anatomically segregated brain regions. The connectivity pattern is formed by statistical patterns measuredas cross-correlations, coherence or other measures related with the activity of the brain.
The studies of patterns of functional connectivity (based on coherence or correlation) among cortical regions have demonstrated that functional brain networks exhibit small-world attributes (Achard et al., 2006) possibly reflecting the underlying structural organization of anatomical connections. More detailed graph theoretic analysis of functional brain connectivity has helped to identify functional hubs, which are highly connected and central to information flow and integration. Functional connectivity studies in the frequency domain have provided evidence for a fractal organization of functional brain networks.
