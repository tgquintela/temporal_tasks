Algorithmics is the science of algorithms. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

Algorithmics includes:
* Algorithm design: the art of building a procedure which can solve efficiently a specific problem or a class of problem
* Algorithmic complexity theory: the study of estimating the hardness of problems by studying the properties of algorithm that solves them
* Algorithm analysis: the science of studying the properties of a problem, such as quantifying resources in time and memory space needed by this algorithm to solve this problem
