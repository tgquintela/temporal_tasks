#Broca-Wernicke model of language
2016-06-01

Broca-Wernicke model of language was formulized by Carl Wernicke, hypothesizing a bundle of long axons connecting Broca's and Wernicke¡s regions. Damaging these connections while leaving both regions without damage will not affect in speech comprehension not eather the production of words intact but it will make impossible to the subject to repeat words of other people. Wernicke called it *conduction aphasia*.

The Broca-Wernicke model of language shows how one might go about using the regional connections.
