2016-06-01

"Social dumping" is a term that is used to describe a practice of employers to use cheaper labour, than is usually available at their site of production and/or selling. 
It could be done by two basic ways:
* Migrant workers are employed taking profit of the globalization free movement agreements.
* Production is moved to a low-wage country or area, taking profit of the globalization free commercial agreements.

While it happens some states are in a dumping-like game where the Nash-equilibrium is less environmental protection, labor protection in order to compensate the losses of having the production in a high-wage region.
