2016-06-01

The ultimatum game is a game in economic experiments. The first player (the proposer) receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between the proposer and the other player. The second player (the responder) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money. The game is typically played only once so that reciprocation is not an issue.

There are huge amount of social experimental studies about this game. It have been usually taken to be as both evidence for and against the so-called *Homo economicus* assumptions of rational, utility-maximizing, individual decisions.
There is also a core experiment in neuroeconomics studies.
