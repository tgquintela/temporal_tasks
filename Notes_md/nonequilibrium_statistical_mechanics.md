#Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics
2016-06-01

Statistical mechanics is a branch of theoretical physics that studies, using probability theory, the average behaviour of a mechanical system where the state of the system is uncertain. A common use of statistical mechanics is in explaining the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics which treats and extends classical thermodynamics is known as statistical thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics. But world is not only about equilibrium. In this systems out of equilibrium the Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics is needed to understand and predict the global system phenomena. This branch deals with the issue of microscopically modelling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat. Unlike with equilibrium, there is no exact formalism that applies to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in general, and so this branch of statistical mechanics remains an active area of theoretical research.
