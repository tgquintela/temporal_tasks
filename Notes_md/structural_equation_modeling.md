2016-06-01

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), refers to a diverse set of mathematical models, computer algorithms, and statistical methods that fit networks of constructs to data. A structural equation model is a set of equations in which each variable is assigned a value that is an explicit function of other variables in the system. SEM includes confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, partial least squares path analysis, LISREL and latent growth modeling. The term should not be confused with Structural Modeling in economics. Structural equation models are often used to assess unobservable 'latent' constructs. They often invoke a measurement model that defines latent variables using one or more observed variables, and a structural model that imputes relationships between latent variables.

Various methods in structural equation modeling have been used in the sciences, business, education, and other fields. Use of SEM methods in analysis is controversial because SEM methods generally lack widely accepted goodness-of-fit statistics and most SEM software offers little latitude for error analysis. This puts SEM at a disadvantage with respect to systems of regression equation methods, though the latter are limited in their ability to fit unobserved 'latent' constructs.
