2016-06-01

Market segmentation is a marketing strategy which involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers, businesses, or countries that have, or are perceived to have, common needs, interests, and priorities, and then designing and implementing strategies to target them. Market segmentation strategies are generally used to identify and further define the target customers, and provide supporting data for marketing plan elements such as positioning to achieve certain marketing plan objectives. Businesses may develop product differentiation strategies, or an undifferentiated approach, involving specific products or product lines depending on the specific demand and attributes of the target segment.

It could be useful in:
* Product design: make a different product for the different needs (product differentiation). Sometimes could be driven by economic reasons. That creates the market strategy of *price discrimination* in which the product designed segmentation is price-driven.
* Marketing: target marketing in order to sell the same product in a differentiate way or to different market segments.

There are two main types of market segmentation:
* Uni-variable segmentation. By a specific features. The more used ones are:
   * Geographically
   * Demographically
   * Behavior
   * Psychographic segmentation
   * Ocasional segmentation
   * By benefits
   * Cultural
* Multi-variable segmentation. Using general combination of features and machine learning algorithms. There are clustering algorithms and unsupervised methods to tackle that problem.

The main decisions to take are the 4 p's:
* Product
* Price
* Promotion
* Place
