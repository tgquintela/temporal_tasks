2016-06-01

Resampling is any of a variety of methods for doing one of the following:
* Estimating the precision of sample statistics (medians, variances, percentiles) by using subsets of available data (jackknifing) or drawing randomly with replacement from a set of data points (bootstrapping).
* Exchanging labels on data points when performing significance tests (permutation tests, also called exact tests, randomization tests, or re-randomization tests)
* Validating models by using random subsets (bootstrapping, cross validation)

Common resampling techniques include:
* bootstrapping
* jackknifing
* permutation tests
* cross-validation
