2016-06-01

AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind to play Go. It was the first Computer Go program to beat a professional human Go player without handicaps on a full 19x19 board. He also wion a 5-game match with a top professional.

The algorithm of AlphaGo is based on a first machine learning extensive trainning using previous data and simulated games, using mainly deep learning methods. All this trainning build policies (_policy network_) and incentives (_value network_) that are used in the moment of playing and taking the decision of each movement by a Monte Carlo tree search.

Go is a highly complex game due to the huge amount of possibilities that its possible moves offers. It is usually considered an intuition game.
