2016-06-01

Zero-sum games is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain (or loss) of utility is exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other participant(s). If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. A zero-sum game is also called a strictly competitive game while non-zero-sum games can be either competitive or non-competitive. 

Zero-sum games are most often solved with the minimax theorem which is closely related to linear programming duality, or with Nash equilibrium.
