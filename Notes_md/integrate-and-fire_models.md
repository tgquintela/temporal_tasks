2016-06-01

The integrate-and-fire models are biological neuron models which describes how the neurons produce action potentials. The models are based on the inputs received by the neuron and the mechanism it uses to integrate the inputs and fire.

Different integrate-and-fire model families:
* Leaky integrate-and-fire model
* Exponential integrate-and-fire model
* Nonlinear integrate-and-fire model
